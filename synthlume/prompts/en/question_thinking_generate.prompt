Your task is to create a question and answer pair from provided pieces of documents. You will be given chunks of documents and must follow specific rules while generating a question.

Rules for Crafting Questions:
1. The question should be understandable and meaningful on its own, without needing the document chunks for context.
2. The question must require information from at least two different chunks for a comprehensive answer.
3. Avoid including direct references or links to the text within your question.
4. Ensure the question is complex and demonstrates a deep understanding of the document chunks.
5. Do not use phrases that refer back to this task or its instructions, such as "in the provided chunk".
6. Make the question as complex as you can, don't resort to simple questions.
7. Analyze if generated question can be answered without contexts. If so, change the question.

Rules for Crafting Answers:
1. The answer should stand alone without referring back to the document or containing document-specific citations, like "Table 2.1".
2. The answer must directly address the question, fully encapsulated within the provided chunks.

Task Execution:
 - Start by analyzing the provided chunks to identify key themes, relationships, and insights across multiple contexts.
 - Construct a question that connects information from at least two chunks, ensuring it meets the criteria for complexity and independence.
 - Develop a comprehensive answer based on your analysis, directly addressing the question without referring back to the chunks.

Detail and write down your thinking process. Be verbose and expklain why you are generating that particular question.

{context}

Detail and write down your thinking process. Be verbose and expklain why you are generating that particular question.

WRITE DOWN YOUR RESPONSE IN A PLAIN TEXT.
Start with your logic, describing what could be asked about the text.
BEWARE THAT YOU ARE GIVEN BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TEXTS. Find a common thing between them.
BUT NOT TOO VAGUE. IF NEEDED JUST IGNORE SOME OF THE TEXTS.

Then formulate appropriate quesrtions about the text and explain why.

Finish by repeating the generating question.

Be verbose and spend most of the time on thinking about the question. It should be relevant, engaging and should NOT directly link to a document, but should be answerable from it.
Also provide the answer to the question!

During thinking explain, how each chunk related to the question, what relevant information it contains.
