"The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.
1.	The DM describes the environment. The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).
2.	The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.",How does a basic game of Dungeons & Dragons progress with respect to the roles of the Dungeon Master and the players?,"In a basic game of Dungeons & Dragons, the Dungeon Master first describes the environment, setting the scene for the players.

"Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.
3.	The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.","In a tabletop role-playing game, what is the process that the game master follows when a player's action results in a challenging situation?","In challenging situations, the Dungeon Master decides what happens.

 This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.",How does the nature of gameplay in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons typically vary with the circumstances?,"Most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.",How does the nature of gameplay in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons typically vary with the circumstances?,"Most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.",Gameplay is always structured with clear turns and actions in all circumstances.,The nature of gameplay does not vary regardless of the circumstances encountered.,"Gameplay typically involves physical challenges based on the circumstances, like quick reflex tests or strength-based tasks."
"Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.","What methods can a Dungeon Master use to help set the scene in a tabletop role-playing game, and how do players also contribute to character portrayal?","A Dungeon Master can use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood of the game.

"The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).
Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.","In the game Dungeons & Dragons, how is the result of a roll of percentile dice, or d100, generated and read, particularly when the ten-sided dice are numbered in tens?","In Dungeons & Dragons, a number between 1 and 100 is generated by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9 for a percentile dice, or d100.

"When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.  The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)",How can one simulate a roll of 1d3 or 1d2 in a tabletop role-playing game using a d6 or any die?,"To simulate the roll of 1d3, one should roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2, rounding up.

"Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.  Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.","In the gameplay of Dungeons & Dragons, how is the success or failure of an action determined?","The success or failure of an action is determined by rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20.

"Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.
1.	Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)
2.	Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.",What are the steps involved in making a d20 roll in a tabletop role-playing game?,"First, you roll the die and add a relevant modifier, which is often the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and at times includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s skill.

"2.	Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
3.	Compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.  The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).  This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.","In a tabletop role-playing game, how is success or failure determined when an action is taken?","The success or failure of an action is determined by comparing the total number (including any circumstantial bonuses and penalties) to a target number.

"Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

"The Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items.

It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.

"Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.
Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.","In a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons, how is exploration carried out?","Exploration in a game like Dungeons & Dragons includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention.

Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.","In the context of the game Dungeons & Dragons, how often does magic occur and how is it viewed by the common folk?","Magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer in Dungeons & Dragons, with common folk seeing evidence of magic on a regular basis.

"For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.  Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face.

What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.  Throughout this chapter, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.

"1. Choose a Race
Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.  The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too.",How do the racial traits of lightfoot halflings and high elves influence their suitability for certain classes in Dungeons & Dragons?,"The racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, while high elves tend to be powerful wizards due to their racial traits.",How do the racial traits of lightfoot halflings and high elves influence their suitability for certain classes in Dungeons & Dragons?,"The racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, while high elves tend to be powerful wizards due to their racial traits.","The racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional wizards, while high elves tend to be powerful rogues due to their racial traits.","The racial traits of humans make them exceptional rogues, while mountain dwarves tend to be powerful wizards due to their racial traits.","In Dungeons & Dragons, racial traits do not affect the suitability for certain classes, making all races equally suitable for all classes."
"Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.  Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.  Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.

Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.
2. Choose a Class
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.",What aspects are considered when creating a character in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons?,"Aspects such as selecting a race, noting the race's traits including starting languages and base speed, increasing abilities scores and choosing a class are considered when creating a character in Dungeons & Dragons.",What aspects are considered when creating a character in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons?,"Aspects such as selecting a race, noting the race's traits including starting languages and base speed, increasing abilities scores and choosing a class are considered when creating a character in Dungeons & Dragons.","Aspects such as selecting a weapon, choosing armor, and deciding on a magical item are considered when creating a character in Dungeons & Dragons.","Aspects such as choosing a background, determining the background's effects, and selecting a personality are considered when creating a character in Dungeons & Dragons.","Aspects such as creating a personal history, developing social circles, and determining life goals are considered when creating a character in Dungeons & Dragons."

"Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.  Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.  Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).

3. Determine Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

"You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.  After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.

The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.  You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.
 This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.","What is the range of ability scores a player can have before applying racial increases when customizing their character's abilities in Dungeons & Dragons, using the variant rule, and how can this enhance flexibility in score distribution?","In the variant rule, the highest ability score a player can end up with, before applying racial increases, is 15, and they can’t have a score lower than 8.

"4. Describe Your Character
Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.
Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.  Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.",What elements are considered when fleshing out a character for a role-playing game?,"Character name, physical appearance, personality traits, alignment, ideals, bonds, flaws, background, and the character’s place in the game world are considered while fleshing out a character.",What elements are considered when fleshing out a character for a role-playing game?,"Character name, physical appearance, personality traits, alignment, ideals, bonds, flaws, background, and the character’s place in the game world are considered while fleshing out a character.","The character's combative abilities, relationship with other characters, and ranking in the game are considered while fleshing out the character.","The character's favorite color, favorite food, alignment, and the character’s place in the game world are considered while fleshing out a character.",The character's background and the character’s place in the game world are the main considerations while fleshing out a character.

Building Bruenor, Step 4
Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.

But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to","What are the implications on a character's personality and backstory in a tabletop role-playing game if he has high Strength and Constitution, low Intelligence, and comes from a noble line?","High Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, while low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.

"reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.  Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.
Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.

"5. Choose Equipment
Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5, 
“Equipment.“
Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5).  Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.

Armor Class
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.  Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.
Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in chapter 5.","In the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, how is a character's Armor Class calculated in the absence of armor or a shield, and what are the implications of wearing armor or carrying a shield without the required proficiency?","Without armor or a shield, a character’s Armor Class equals 10 plus his or her Dexterity modifier.

"Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.
Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.  When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

Building Bruenor, Step 5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.  For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.
