"The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.
1.	The DM describes the environment. The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).
2.	The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.","In a Dungeons & Dragons game, what is the typical sequence of actions between the Dungeon Master and the players, and how do their roles differ?","The Dungeon Master starts the game by describing the environment.
