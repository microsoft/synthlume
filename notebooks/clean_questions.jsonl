's (LGES) Baa1 issuer rating incorporates its solid underlying credit\nstrength and a two-notch rating uplift.\nLGES' underlying credit strength is primarily underpinned by its leading position in the global\nelectric vehicle (EV) battery industry, high customer and geographic diversification, and\nstrong growth prospects with high revenue visibility supported by favorable market demand\nand large order backlog. These strengths are counterbalanced by large capital spending from\nsignificant capacity expansion, which will incur sizable debt and raises execution risks in\nmanaging operational challenges and improving profitability.\nThe two-notch uplift reflects our expectation that the company will receive strong parental\nsupport from LG Chem, Ltd.  (A3 stable) in times of stress, given LGES' strategic importance\nto the parent and LG group, and LG Chem's good ability to provide such support.\nDespite the large capital spending, we expect LGES\u2019 adjusted debt/EBITDA to remain broadly\nhealthy at 2.7x-3.1x in 2022-23, largely similar to the 3.1x in 2021, mainly because strong\nearnings growth will offset significant debt growth.

The\ngovernment wants more than 20% of Chinese auto sales to come from NEVs (electric,\nfuel-cell and plug-in hybrids) by 2025, up from nearly 3% in 2017. This goal is ambitious\nbut achievable for several reasons: government\u2019s ability to influence supply and demand\nthrough policy; China\u2019s low auto penetration and strong NEV sales growth; our view that\nNEV prices will decline with production volume increases and technological advances .\n\u00bbAutomakers: Increasing NEV production will likely compress profitability.\nIncreased R&D and investment in NEVs will require offsetting savings, which will be\ndifficult for Chinese automakers to achieve. And competition is increasing among NEV\nmakers because of new entrants.\n\u00bbAuto-parts suppliers: Demand for internal combustion engine parts could decline\nbeginning in the early 2020s.

It examines the implications for automotive manufacturers, parts suppliers, and other related industries, evaluating how the increased focus on electric and hybrid vehicles may affect their creditworthiness and future financial health."}, "current_document": "data/moodys_data/PBC_1124332.pdf", "question": "Based on Moody's report, what are the potential credit rating implications for the automotive, parts suppliers, and related sectors due to China's ambitious goal to increase new energy vehicle sales by 2025?", "answer": "The Moody's report suggests that, due to China's policy aiming for an increase in new energy vehicle (NEV) sales, the automotive sector might face varying credit rating implications. For automakers, increased NEV production to meet the aggressive sales targets could compress profitability due to higher R&D costs and investment, which would be credit negative. Auto parts suppliers may experience a decline in demand for internal combustion engine parts, beginning in the early 2020s, which might also negatively affect their credit ratings. On the other hand, industries that support the NEV market, such as metals miners and chemical companies, could see a positive impact on their credit ratings from the growth in NEV production and sales.", "raw_contexts": ["MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES\n\u00a9 2019 Moody\u2019s Corporation, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., Moody\u2019s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, \u201cMOODY\u2019S\u201d).
